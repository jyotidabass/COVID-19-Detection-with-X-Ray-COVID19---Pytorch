Maybe, I learn Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning to build my own C-3PO like the young Anakin Skywalker did but I would build a Bot for Health Care to help Humans in saving the Humanity. As it is the need of the time in this dreadful pandemic. Ok, lets consider building an Bot like see in Star Wars, ability to process what it sees will be our first priority right? Else our C-3PO will be blind 😂. \n\nComputer Vision is a field of artificial intelligence that enables machines the ability to \"See\" things. The word \"See\" is not what you think of it as just what a camera do, capturing moments. But thats not it, \"See\" means that machine can able to perceive things and understands the difference or relation between the real world physical entities. This state of \"See\" is we achieved now takes a lot of hard word, research and iterations. We achieved it by solving little pieces of it like Image Classification, Image Segmentation and Object Segmentation, etc. \n\n> We are so blessed to be born in this period, as we have a plethora of resesources and community of people to guide us through.\n\n### Why AI in Health Care is crucial?\nThough many fields can be benificial by the implementation of Artificial Intelligence, it is the field of Health Care which would be benifitted the most and in turn Humanity. It very hard to diagnose X-ray scans, and take decisions deterministically at the right momemt. There is also human errors associated with it. Computers can contribute a ton to Health and Medicine as an \"SideKick\" to humans(Doctors). I wouldn't say Computer can outperform with absolute percision, it may have fail in some cases. That's why we have computers to assist Doctors.\n\n![Pneumoia Detection](https://i.imgur.com/jZqpV51.png)\n\n<font color=\"red\">If you find this notebook helpful please do upvote this notebook.

It is developed and used by Facebook AI Research Lab. It has been library which attracted many researchers and develop many State-of-the-Art Algorithms across all the fields of Deep Learning such as Computer Vision, NLP and Tabular Data Processing. \n\n### Why learn PyTorch?\nPyTorch is home for many powerful projects and future researches in Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence. FaceBook AI Research (FAIR) contributed an enormous amount of new mind boggling researches and projects built o PyTorch. Detectron2(CV), HugginngFace(NLP),DETR(CV) are some of amazing projects by them based on PyTorch. So you will be able to see and develop your own State-of-the-Art applications inspiring from these projects. And also PyTorch is so friendly looking with most of the code will look like vanila \"Python\" Structures.\n> I learnt PyTorch after I got comfortable with Tensorflow/Keras. I think PyTorch has more flexibility for a coder and Customizable. I get to know the process behind the Traning of Model better with PyTorch.\n\n## Let's get started\nOk, I can hear you say \"ENOUGH\".

But we should contribute our role in this fight against an invisible enemy. \n\n> Many Data Scientist are working getting predictions and developing models for strategies. We can assist HealthCare workers and Doctors by developing a AI Assistment or Model. A Image Classification model can handle a lot of worries for Doctors, especially in X Ray Diagnosis.\n\n**In this notebook, I am going to train a CNN classifier which can classify COVID-19 Infected Lung Xray images from Healthy Lung Xray images.

So shall we start writing our training code?\n\nWe are not using any wrapper class like Keras for Tensorflow, PyTorchLightning for PyTorch, we are going to write the training code ourselves from scratch. We won't regret mastering writing the Trainer code for pytorch, it would help you a ton with theoretical understanding with lavishness. \n\n- `model.train()` and `model.eval()` are called respectively on Training and Evaluation phase.\n- Intialise Loss and Accuracy Variable of the epochs to zero\n- Passing an `dataloader` object to a interative function we get Image Data and Label in batches for every loop\n- Transfer the `Data` and `label` to GPU if available\n- If it's Training Phase, we find Gradients and perform Back Progation for that we write the code under `torch.set_grad_enabled()` to instruct the PyTorch to consider the parameters for Backpropagation updation.\n- Feed in the `Data` (X) to the `model` and it will output `outputs` (Y).\n- Calculate the loss using `label` and `outputs` using criterion `nn.CrossEntropyLoss()` \n- With the loss, we can now find the gradients and perform Backprogation using `loss.backward()` and optimizer `optim.Adam()` with defined LR\n- `optim.lr_scheduler.StepLR()` will update the LR based on the parameters defined.\n- Find the epoch accuracy and epoch loss for both training and validation phase.\n- Additionally we find validation kappa score. Kappa score is a trusted metric for evaluating Medical AI Models. You can learn more about [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/interpretation-of-kappa-values-2acd1ca7b18f)\n\n**Note : Important step while training in PyTorch is `optimizer.zero_grad()` because PyTorch haves caches of gradients in the memory, we have to zero that out while each step.**\n\n\n#### Early Stopping\nEarly Stopping is a method of choosing the best performed model with given conditions. Generally the conditions would be Best Validation Accuracy or Lowest Validation Loss. For this model, I choose the model with lowest validation loss for better reliable results from the model. Because more medical model is gonna diagnose a person, we dont want a false positive or false negative. \n\nTo do that we will check for lowest validation loss at every epoch and save the model parameters weights into a object and finally load the weights to the model using `model.load_state_dict()`.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def train_model(model, criterion, optimizer, scheduler, num_epochs=10):\n    since = time.time()\n\n    best_model_wts = copy.deepcopy(model.state_dict())\n    best_loss = np.inf\n\n    for epoch in range(num_epochs):\n        print('Epoch {}/{}'.format(epoch+1, num_epochs))\n        print('-' * 10)\n\n        # Each epoch has a training and validation phase\n        for phase in ['train', 'val']:\n            if phase == 'train':\n                model.train()  # Set model to training mode\n            else:\n                model.eval()   # Set model to evaluate mode\n\n            current_loss = 0.0\n            current_corrects = 0\n            current_kappa = 0\n            val_kappa = list()\n\n            for inputs, labels in tqdm.tqdm(dataloaders[phase], desc=phase, leave=False):\n                inputs = inputs.to(device)\n                labels = labels.to(device)\n\n                # We need to zero the gradients in the Cache.\n                optimizer.zero_grad()\n\n                # Time to carry out the forward training poss\n                # We only need to log the loss stats if we are in training phase\n                with torch.set_grad_enabled(phase == 'train'):\n                    outputs = model(inputs)\n                    _, preds = torch.max(outputs, 1)\n                    loss = criterion(outputs, labels)\n\n                    # backward + optimize only if in training phase\n                    if phase == 'train':\n                        loss.backward()\n                        optimizer.step()\n                if phase == 'train':\n                    scheduler.step()\n\n                # We want variables to hold the loss statistics\n                current_loss += loss.item() * inputs.size(0)\n                current_corrects += torch.sum(preds == labels.data)\n                val_kappa.append(cohen_kappa_score(preds.cpu().numpy(), labels.data.cpu().numpy()))\n            epoch_loss = current_loss / data_sizes[phase]\n            epoch_acc = current_corrects.double() / data_sizes[phase]\n            if phase == 'val':\n                epoch_kappa = np.mean(val_kappa)\n                print('{} Loss: {:.4f} | {} Accuracy: {:.4f} | Kappa Score: {:.4f}'.format(\n                    phase, epoch_loss, phase, epoch_acc, epoch_kappa))\n            else:\n                print('{} Loss: {:.4f} | {} Accuracy: {:.4f}'.format(\n                    phase, epoch_loss, phase, epoch_acc))\n\n            # EARLY STOPPING\n            if phase == 'val' and epoch_loss < best_loss:\n                print('Val loss Decreased from {:.4f} to {:.4f} \\nSaving Weights...
